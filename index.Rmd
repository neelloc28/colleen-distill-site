## About me:

I'm a senior at Macalester College with a major in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and a minor in Psychology.  I love using data to answer important, intriguing, and meaningful questions.  In my free time, I enjoy trying out new recipes, making jigsaw puzzles, and going on walks while listening to music.  Feel free to take a look around at some of the projects I have worked on!
